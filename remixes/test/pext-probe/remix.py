"""PEXT PROBE on FX1 beside the stock effects: PLATE REV and SPRING REV give up their words, and EQUALIZER's id is the probe's.

A measurement instrument for one hardware run (modules/pextprobe/README.md): it tests how far P
memory reaches above P:0x2000 on each DSP core and reports it in the audio of the track it sits on; USB
carries the tracks (16 channels, PRE) to the host, which is where the report is read."""
