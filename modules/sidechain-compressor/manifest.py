"""SIDECHAIN_COMPRESSOR -- stock COMPRESSOR with a side-chain KEY from any track and a base-width key filter: MON, KEY, KGN, KBAS and KWID on page 2.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `554ca1c`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/sidechain-compressor/manifest.py`: two linked units
(`patch_sidechain.s`, and `ui_switch.s`: KEY's 9-position rotary switch and KWID's link clip),
placed in a ROM cave or DRAM by the `PLACE` setting
(`octabam.sidechain-compressor`, default CAVE), re-linked and compared with the author's own bytes
(`reference`) every build, and a DSP section reached only from four hooks
(`MenuEntry.stock_dsp`: the effect is stock COMPRESSOR). Its source paths are
derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the source on disk,
as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only re-exports its
MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.
