"""MORPH -- [TRACK]+[UP] / [TRACK]+[DOWN]: a track's scene morph (A -> B -> A) runs by itself.

A morphing track's A/B weight comes from a triangle of one cycle = STEPS x x sequencer 16th steps
(default 16 x 8 = 128; STEPS 0 = the track's length), counted on the sequencer's step word, always
starting on scene A on the step after the keys, instead of from the crossfader; the other tracks
keep the crossfader. MODE SMOOTH or TRIG HOLD. [TRACK]+[DOWN] lets the cycle finish on A and parks
the track there until the crossfader reaches its A end. Inspired by the Korg Electribe's Motion
Sequence. [TRACK]+[UP] opens the window (A STEPS, B x 1..100, C MODE, the stock scene indicator);
it stays open: YES starts the held tracks on the next step, NO closes and starts nothing. Either
way they are ARMED: a track key held ~1 s alone then starts and stops that track's morph (the long
press, v1.1). The settings, which tracks morph and which are ARMED are saved with the project in
morph.work (a STORE client, modules/store).

Sites, measured from the user's 1.40C (base 0x40000400; modules/morph/README.md):
  * the frame builder at 0x4000cc62 (`move.l #96,%macsr ; lea 12(%sp),%sp`, 10 bytes): once a
    frame, after the per-track loop and before 0x4000cc6c, where every path that reads the
    per-track weights 0x80003c60.. starts. No branch in the image lands inside the 10 bytes.
  * the [TRACK]-held key layer 0x400d164a: its keys field 0x400d164e (stock 0x400d1594) points at
    the unit's copy of the stock table with UP (0x33) and DOWN (0x20) added. Beside
    REC_TRIG_MUTE, which repoints stock's YES/NO records, HOOKS owns the field instead and its
    table carries both (modules/hooks, track_key); MORPH's own copy is then not read. YES and NO
    inside the open window are the window's own layer (MW_KEYS), not this one.
  * the long press: the PRESS field of T1..T8 in the MKI key table 0x400bfc10 and the MKII one
    0x400c01f4 (stock 0x40040250) points at lp_tpress, which calls stock first (TRACK MENU's site,
    measured on the owner's MKI, 24 Oct 2026). Not a HOOKS bridge.
