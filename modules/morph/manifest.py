"""MORPH -- [TRACK]+[UP] / [TRACK]+[DOWN]: a track's scene morph (A -> B -> A) runs by itself.

A morphing track's A/B weight comes from a triangle of one cycle = STEPS x x sequencer 16th steps
(default 16 x 8 = 128; STEPS 0 = the track's length), counted on the sequencer's step word, always
starting on scene A on the step after the keys, instead of from the crossfader; the other tracks
keep the crossfader. MODE SMOOTH or TRIG HOLD. [TRACK]+[DOWN] lets the cycle finish on A and parks
the track there until the crossfader reaches its A end. Inspired by the Korg Electribe's Motion
Sequence. [TRACK]+[UP] opens the window (A STEPS, B x 1..16, C MODE) and arms the held tracks;
releasing the track keys starts them on the next step. The settings and which tracks morph are
saved with the project in morph.work (a STORE client, modules/store).

Sites, measured from the user's 1.40C (base 0x40000400; modules/morph/README.md):
  * the frame builder at 0x4000cc62 (`move.l #96,%macsr ; lea 12(%sp),%sp`, 10 bytes): once a
    frame, after the per-track loop and before 0x4000cc6c, where every path that reads the
    per-track weights 0x80003c60.. starts. No branch in the image lands inside the 10 bytes.
  * the [TRACK]-held key layer 0x400d164a: its keys field 0x400d164e (stock 0x400d1594) points at
    the unit's copy of the stock table with UP (0x33) and DOWN (0x20) added.
