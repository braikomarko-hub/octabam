| MORPH v1.1 -- [TRACK]+[UP] / [TRACK]+[DOWN] / a track key held: a track's scene morph runs by itself.
|
| A morphing track's A/B weight is not the crossfader's: every frame this unit writes it from a
| triangle A -> B -> A over one cycle of N sequencer 16th steps, always starting on A. The other
| tracks keep the crossfader. [TRACK]+[DOWN] lets the cycle finish on A; the track then stays
| PARKED on A until the crossfader reaches its A end (xf 127), and only then follows the fader.
|
| v1 (22 Oct 2026; v0 on the owner's MKI, ACIDV73MP, 21 Oct: the triangle, the keys, the parking;
| v1 on the unit as ACIDV74MP, 22 Oct):
|   * per track: STEPS (0 = the track's pattern length, 1..64), x (1..100; v1 had 1..16 and
|     41.625), MODE (SMOOTH / TRIG HOLD); N = STEPS * x, at most 6400. The defaults, 16 x 8
|     SMOOTH, are v0's 128 steps.
|   * the cycle follows the sequencer's step word instead of counting frames: k = the steps since
|     the start, so TRIG HOLD changes exactly on the steps and nothing drifts over many cycles;
|     SMOOTH adds the fraction of the step from the frames since the last step and the tempo.
|   * a start waits for the next step (ARMED), so the cycle begins on the grid.
|   * the window ([TRACK]+[UP], below) stays open; YES starts the held tracks on the next step,
|     NO starts nothing; either way they are ARMED, and a track key held ~1 s alone then starts and
|     stops that track (v1.1, 26 Oct 2026: the long press, below; also on the MIXER page). The
|     window shows the main page's scene indicator for its track.
|   * the settings and which tracks morph are saved with the project (morph.work, through STORE,
|     below); a loaded project's morphs start again from A on the first step after PLAY.
|
| Measured from the user's 1.40C (morph_disasm.txt, 21 Oct 2026; base 0x40000400):
|   * per-track weight longs 0x80003c60 + 4*t, ten of them (8 tracks + 2 unknown). Written only by
|     the two crossfader writers 0x40061e2e / 0x400626a8, read only by the frame builder's six
|     morph paths (0x4000cca4, cd2a, cd84, ce06, ce4c, cf04), all after 0x4000cc6c.
|   * writer formula, replicated here: w = (short) curve[xf] at 0x400bcd90 (0, -258 .. -32768),
|     weight = (w << 16) | ((0xffff8000 - w) & 0xffff). The morph multiplies the HIGH word with
|     scene A's value and the LOW word with scene B's (path 0x4000ce60): xf 127 = all A, 0 = all B.
|   * the per-frame hook: 0x4000cc62 `move.l #96,%macsr ; lea 12(%sp),%sp` (10 bytes), after the
|     per-track loop and before 0x4000cc6c, where every morph path starts. No branch in the
|     image targets 0x4000cc63..0x4000cc6b. This stub saves and restores what it uses.
|   * tempo24 = BPM*24 at 0x8000181c (latched per frame; docs/firmware/DSP.md); transport
|     0x800065b8 is running if and only if it holds 1 (docs/firmware/STEM_REC.md 1.0).
|   * the sequencer's step word 0x800065b2 (u16) and the current pattern's track record (bank blob
|     0x46c82456 + pattern 0x100b14d0 * 0x8ed8 + track * 0x91a, the length at +0x50): OCTA303's
|     303 gate reads both on the unit (modules/octa303/octa303.s o3_gate).
|   * the [TRACK]-held key layer's table 0x400d1594 (6 records + terminator); this unit carries a
|     copy with UP (0x33) and DOWN (0x20) added, and the build repoints the layer's keys field
|     0x400d164e at it. Handler convention (stock 0x40083488, Zac Kyoti's REC_TRIG_MUTE):
|     handler(keycode @4, event @8), event 1 = press; d0/d1/a0/a1 only, d2-d7 are the caller's.
| Inferred, not measured: that the frame builder runs once per 16-sample frame (a step is
| 992,250 / tempo24 frames on that assumption: SMOOTH's fraction of a step uses it); that the
| step word counts every 16th of the master length while playing.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- the window
| [TRACK]+[UP] opens a TEMPO-class window over the page for the tracks held at that moment (the
| structure of ilia-murzinov's EUCLID FILL, modules/euclid-fill: WCREATE / WFRAME / WDESTROY, an
| input layer pushed over everything, the stock text and box routines, y counted up from the
| bottom). It stays open when the track keys are let go. While it is open:
|   A  STEPS (0 = TRK, the track's length, 1..64)     B  x (1..100)     C  MODE (SMOOTH / HOLD)
|   YES  close, and the held tracks start on the next step (from A)
|   NO or UP  close, nothing starts; the window's tracks stay ARMED for the long press (below)
|   DOWN  stop (as [TRACK]+[DOWN])
|   RIGHT / LEFT  the LOCK pages (the recorded knob values as bars) and back; see "the LOCK page".
|   While the window is open LEFT and RIGHT are the window's: stock's tempo nudge does not reach.
|   Known limit: changing page while a trig key is held pushes the window's layer back on top of
|   stock's held-trig layer (its knobs then go where the page says, not to the trig's locks).
| Either way the window's tracks are ARMED (mp_prime): a track key held ~1 s alone then starts and
| stops that track's morph (the long press, below). A soft timer (~60 Hz) redraws the state, the
| step and the scenes when they change.
| The settings shown are the first window track's; an edit sets every window track to the value.
| From a key handler, as EUCLID FILL opens its window from the PAGE handler.
|
| The bottom row's right end is the stock scene indicator of the main page's footer, drawn the way
| stock draws it (measured, 26 Oct 2026): 0x4004d640 sets two boxes x 95..103 and 109..117, y 0..6,
| on the footer, writes scene A and scene B (bank + part * 0x18b2 + 0x8ed90 / 0x8ed91, from 0,
| shown from 1) with 0x40013904 (FONT, x 0x60 / 0x6e, y 1, "%02d" 0x400b437c, width "00"
| 0x400b4382, inverted); 0x4003577c sets the box x 104..108, y 0..6, clears y 2..4 and draws the
| 5 x 3 sprite 0x400bcd7c[4 - ((xf + 16) >> 5)], 0..4, at (104, 2). Here the same calls, moved to
| the window's bottom right corner, with the xf of the window's first track: its morph's while it
| morphs, A while it is parked, else the crossfader's.

| live recording works while the bars are watched. (An encoder the table does not list goes on to
| stock: measured in the port, 30 Oct 2026, D with the MORPH window open.) The firmware takes the
| table when the layer is pushed (measured the same day: changed under a pushed layer, A still
| reached mw_enc), so with the layer up it is popped and pushed again around the change, as
| mw_close pops it from a key handler. Clobbers d0, d1, a0, a1.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- the LOCK page (LOCK VIEW)
| RIGHT in the window: the first window track's recorded knob values (its page-1 parameter locks)
| on the parameter page under the window, one bar per step, 16 steps a page. Inspired by DOOM OS's
| FX Automation page on the SP-404MKII. Read only: it reads the pattern, never writes it. Where the
| bytes live is Sam's docs/firmware/STEP_LOCKS.md, PARAM_PAGES.md (OS 1.40C):
|   track record  bank + pattern * 0x8ed8 + track * 0x91a (pattern: 0x100b14d0)
|   trigs         the record's first 8 bytes, big-endian, bit n = step n + 1 (port, 30 Oct 2026)
|   lock          record + 0x59 + step * 32 + flat, 0xff = none; flat = page * 6 + knob
|   page          0x460d1684: 0 SRC, 1 LFO, 2 AMP, 3 FX1, 4 FX2 (tools/panel/KEYMAP.md)
|   Part value    bank + part * 0x18b2 + 0x8edaa + t * 30 + machine * 6 + k (SRC), or

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- the long press
| A track key held ~1 s alone (as TRACK MENU v1 measured it on the owner's MKI, 24 Oct 2026): the
| PRESS field of the eight track records of the MKI key table 0x400bfc10 and the MKII one
| 0x400c01f4 (press = release = repeat = 0x40040250) points at lp_tpress, which calls the stock
| handler first, then counts with a soft timer while that track key stays the only key down (HELD
| 0x460fab40 = 1 << t, the panel rows 0x46100b18 show no key that was not down at the press).
| FUNC or CUE down at the press (mute, cue), MIDI mode, our window open, another key, another
| track or the release: nothing. At ~1 s, on an ARMED track (mp_prime: it has been in the window):
| on the fader or parked -> it starts on the next step (from A); morphing -> it stops at the end
| of its cycle, on A, then parks there (as [TRACK]+[DOWN]); stopping -> it carries on; waiting for
| its step -> back to the fader. A toast says which: T2 MORPH ON / T2 MORPH OFF.
| d0/d1/a0/a1 only (d2-d7 are the caller's).
