"""PEXT PROBE -- where can a DSP core keep code besides its stock P memory?

A measurement source, not an effect: an insert that replaces its track's audio
with a 32-bit status word per frame (the sign of each of the frame's 32
samples), and, once its GO select is turned, runs a ladder of seven tests: LOW,
a control at P:0x1fe0 and P memory at 0x2000..0x3800; WIN, read, write and
execute at seven words of the shared window. A capture of the track's audio (the USB
audio out) reads the result with modules/pextprobe/decode.py, and keeps it if
the core freezes on the way. modules/pextprobe/README.md is the procedure.

A test instrument: it ships in no remix but remixes/test/pext-probe.
