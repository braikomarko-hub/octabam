"""VARISPEED -- STATIC/FLEX TSTR VARI: tempo-locked varispeed, QUAN on PTCH, nothing emulated.

Source: `upstream/` is Zac Kyoti's repository (Zac-Kyoti/octatrack-kyoti-fw,
submodule, pinned to `9b2e35a`). The declaration is
`upstream/octabam-modules/varispeed/manifest.py`: the linked unit `vari_cf`
(`varispeed.s`, VARISPEED_EMUS's source with its switch at 0, read from
`../varispeed-emus/` in the same checkout, with QUAN's rotary switch `tools/ui_switch.s`
inlined, its symbols local), re-linked and compared with the author's own
bytes (`reference`) every build, and `vari_store` (`varispeed_store.s`, its STORE handlers),
both placed in DRAM or a ROM cave by the `PLACE` setting (default DRAM); 16 detours and four
pokes; no DSP section. It requires STORE: the PART menu's CLEAR (0x4004a9d0) is STORE's
site, and VARISPEED holds and forgets there as a client (partclear, partsaved). Its source paths are
derived from its own directory, so it is executed here from the source on disk,
as the registry does for every manifest, and this file only re-exports its
MODULE. Nothing inside `upstream/` is edited here.

On hardware: the author's MKI, 15 Oct 2026 (VARI1 build); QUAN as a 9-position rotary switch, 23 Oct 2026
(standalone image).
