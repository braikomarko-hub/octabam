"""A remix in many configurations, stamped in advance, stepped over USB MIDI, measured over USB audio.

One USB cable to the unit and nothing else: program change selects a
layout, MIDI START plays it, the unit's own USB audio stream is the
capture, and LOAD METER (vendor request 0xc0/0x57, tools/hw/load_meter.py)
is the load readout where the image carries it.

LAYOUTS. Effect selection cannot be driven over MIDI, but every effect id
and knob byte lives in the project and a pattern selects a part
(tools/hw/ot_ladder.py). A project here holds 32 layouts: 8 banks, and in
each bank patterns 1-4 playing parts 1-4, one layout per part. Program
change `16 * bank + (pattern - 1)` selects one. `plan` prints the layouts a
remix gets; `proj` writes them to DEST_PREFIX_01, _02, ... (32 to a
project), each with OCTABAM_MATRIX.json beside the project files.

  Layout 0 of every project is BASE: no effect of ours, the baseline every
  other layout's level, high band and click count are compared with.
  octabam / octabam-bus: each FX2 effect on all eight tracks
    alone, then each FX1 effect on all eight alone, each at its manifest
    defaults, at its `dear` settings, and in each MODE (with and without
    `dear`). --pairs adds every FX1 x FX2 pair on all eight tracks at `dear`.
  octabam-bus: the bus rig as the ladder's RIG rung has it on FX2 (BusDelay
    on T1, BusVerb on T5, SEND elsewhere), then each FX1 station on all
    eight tracks in the same variants, and the stock DELAY on T8's FX2.

MATERIAL. By default every pattern plays SRC's pattern A2 (--pattern). With
--stimuli the project plays synthetic material instead (tools/hw/ot_stimuli.py):
the WAVs are written beside the project files, FLEX slots 1..N name them
(PATH is the bare file name) with their trim records in markers.work, the
--stim-tracks tracks (default all eight) take them round-robin as looping FLEX
machines, and each pattern is one trig on step 1 of 64 steps at 1X, so at 120
BPM (recorded in OCTABAM_MATRIX.json as `bpm`, which `run` uses) a stimulus
restarts exactly when its 2, 4 or 8 s ends. The stimuli's expected levels and
events are in OCTABAM_STIMULI.json. The project has no .ot attribute files.

SETTINGS. Every project gets the [SETTINGS] and [STATES] keys a run depends on
stamped as text (STORAGE.md section 5): CLOCK and TRANSPORT RECEIVE on, SEND off,
PROGRAM CHANGE RECEIVE on at --pc-channel (default 1) and SEND off, MIDI_TRIG_CH1-8
= channels 1-8, auto channel and soft thru off, per-pattern tempo off, metronome off,
TEMPOx24 = 120 BPM with --stimuli; the project opens on A01 with no mute, solo or cue
mask. --setting KEY=INT stamps any other key (MAIN_LEVEL, MASTER_TRACK, GAIN_AB, ...);
the keys that changed, with their old and new values, are in OCTABAM_MATRIX.json as
`settings_changed`. Audio-level keys not named here keep the template's values.

CLEAN. With --clean, SRC is a project the unit created and nobody edited, and
nothing of the template's content survives except its first pattern and first part
as the container: all 16 banks are rebuilt, every pattern empty but the stamped ones
(trigs and locks cleared, LEN 64 at 1X), every part record the template's with
only the stamped layouts on top, banks I-P and the unused patterns left empty.
`audit PROJECT` lists what is not default (trigs, parameter locks, part records
that differ from bank A's first, LFO depths, sample paths); --clean refuses a
template it finds edited unless --allow-dirty-template. Every project on this
machine's ~/octa fails the audit (they descend from one working project), so
a fresh one has to be created on the unit (PROJECT > NEW) and copied off.
BASE keeps the bus remix's SEND on FX2 at level 0 rather than id 0 (an FX2 stored as 0
gets no page from the firmware, ot_project.make_clean_project).

THE RUN. For each layout: STOP, program change, the page-1 CCs of the
layout's modules asserted over MIDI (the ladder's rule), START with a
continuous 24 ppqn clock, `--play` s, STOP, `--tail` s. One CoreAudio input
stream stays open for the whole run (a stream opened and closed per layout
is the churn usb_probe.py chases); each layout's samples are analysed and
dropped, and kept as a WAV only when flagged. LOAD METER is polled every
0.25 s through the play phase.

FLAGS per layout, against BASE of the same project, all thresholds initial
and not validated on a unit (constants at the top of this file):

  CRASH     no channel above -80 dBFS in the first 2 s of play where BASE had audio:
            the sequencer stuck on step 1. The run stops: only a power cycle clears it.
  FREEZE    every channel at or below -80 dBFS for 1 s or more at times BASE had audio;
            reported with its second; the transport is restarted and the run goes on.
  CLICKS    discontinuity events (|second difference| far above its neighbourhood's
            median) more than BASE's by CLICK_EXTRA and CLICK_RATIO.
  STATIC    8-16 kHz power up STATIC_DB or more over BASE's.
  LEVEL     rms differs from BASE's by LEVEL_DB or more.
  CLIP      samples at full scale.
  RINGS     the last half second of the tail is above SETTLE_DBFS and BASE's is not: the layout is still
            sounding 2.5-3 s after STOP.
  DROPS     LOAD METER's DSP record failed its checks more than DROPS_BAD times in the play window (frames were
            skipped): 0 in every layout but EUCLID FX1 + LOFI2 FX2, where the median frame rate was only 7 % low.
  OVERLOAD  the frame interrupt ran under 80 % of 2,756 a second in the play window: the DSP missed its frames
            (the load was past its budget) and the unit stays degraded; the run stops. Power-cycle.
  LOAD      LOAD METER's frame-interrupt share or a DSP core's busy/period above LOAD_FRAC, from
            LOAD_SKIP_S into the play phase (the first seconds carry the previous layout's load).

What it cannot see: what the material is (a gap in a loop looks like a
dropout only when BASE has none at that time), a fault that BASE has too,
anything the USB stream hides (the module's rate and fill are in
usb_counters.py), and the unit's analog outputs.
